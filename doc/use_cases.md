# Use Cases  

## Background  
###

## Objectives  
###  Achieve robust and efficient clustering of a large unlabled datasets (e.g, ChEMBL with 1.8M chemicals) by:
###  1. Explore autoencoder neural network to lower the features dimension of the given dataset
###  2. Adapt K-mean clustering algorithm to the low dimensional features
###  3. Evaluate the clustering result by the loss function of the autoencoder, the convergence of K-mean method
###     and the compatibility between the autoencoder and the k-mean method.

## Components  

### Data Cleaning  

### Embedding Layers

### Clustering  

### Validation  

1. Smaller synthetic dataset   
A small synthetic dataset that contains 100+ of feature and 1000+ of data points is used to evaluate

2. Larger unlabeled dataset
